Hotel Management System
Overview
The Hotel Management System is a web-based application that allows users to manage hotel rooms. This simple system lets users view available rooms, book a room, and release a booked room. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the functionality powered by JavaScript to dynamically update the room statuses.

Features
View All Rooms: Displays a list of all rooms with their current status (Booked/Available).
Book a Room: Allows users to book a room (if available).
Release a Room: Allows users to release a booked room (if already booked).
Responsive Design: Built with Bootstrap, the design is responsive and works on different screen sizes.
Technologies Used
HTML for the structure of the web page.
CSS for styling and layout, with the help of Bootstrap for responsive design.
JavaScript for handling the functionality of booking and releasing rooms dynamically.
Setup Instructions
To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
If you haven't already, you can clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hotel-management-system.git
Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username.

2. Install Dependencies (Optional)
If you are using any additional packages or libraries (e.g., Bootstrap or others) via a package manager, install them using npm (optional in this case as we're using CDN links for libraries like Bootstrap).

bash
Copy code
npm install
However, this project is currently using CDN links for external libraries like Bootstrap, so no additional dependencies are required.

3. Open the Project in a Browser
Once you have the repository on your local machine, navigate to the project directory and open the index.html file in your preferred browser:

bash
Copy code
cd hotel-management-system
open index.html  # or double-click index.html file
This should open the hotel management system in your web browser.

hotel-management-system/
│
├── index.html        # The main HTML file (structure of the website)
├── styles.css        # The CSS file (styling of the website)

How It Works
1. Viewing Rooms
When the page loads, it automatically displays the rooms available for booking. Rooms are displayed as a list, showing their room number, type, and current status (Booked or Available).

2. Booking a Room
To book a room, click the Book a Room button. You will be prompted to enter the room number. If the room is available, it will be marked as "Booked."

3. Releasing a Room
To release a room, click the Release a Room button. You will be prompted to enter the room number. If the room is booked, it will be released and marked as "Available."
